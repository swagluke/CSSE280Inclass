    <p>I love the movie cause I'm also a frat brother. This movie descibes the classical frat life. </p>

    <h2>Storyline</h2>
    <p>When they arrive at college, socially inept freshmen Larry (Thomas Hulce) and Kent (Stephen Furst)
        attempt to pledge the snooty Omega Theta Pi House, but are summarily rejected. Lowering their standards,
        they try at the notoriously rowdy Delta Tau Chi House, and get in. The trouble is, the college dean
        (John Vernon) has it in for the Deltas. He has put them on "Double Secret Probation" and secretly assigned
        Omega's president (James Daughton) the task of having their charter revoked.

    <h2>Details:</h2>
    <p>In 1962, Faber College freshmen Lawrence "Larry" Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to join a fraternity.
        Finding themselves out of place at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, they visit the slovenly Delta
        Tau Chi house next door, where Kent is a "legacy" who cannot be rejected due because his brother had been a
        member. John "Bluto" Blutarsky welcomes them, and they meet other Deltas including biker Daniel Simpson
        "D-Day" Day, ladies' man Eric "Otter" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald "Boon" Schoenstein, whose
        girlfriend Katy is constantly pressuring him to stop drinking with the Deltas and do something with his
        life. Larry and Kent are invited to pledge and given the fraternity names "Pinto" and "Flounder"
        respectively, by Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms. </p>
